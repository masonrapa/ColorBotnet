# ColorBotnet
Simple python botnet on one-by-one orders (not looping all the devices)

botnet.py -> server for receive all the connections at once

target.py -> client that receive the orders from the master client, execute them and gives back the answer of each command

admin.py -> client with privileges for sending data to the server (you need to select at first the client you wanna send directly)


The different commands are:

list - just shows the available connections (clients recognized by the server)

connect <ip:port> - connect directly your orders (as admin) to the selected target

runcmd <cmd> - executes a console command on the target's device (and give you back the answer if any)
  
script - infinite open window loop (designed for RAM killer)
  
fread <path_to_file> - gives you the content of some file
 
clear - clear the admin terminal 
  
splash <url> - shows up a browser window on the target's screen with the chosen URL
  
hlogs - gets back the login data registered locally as Link / User / Password
  
hlink -  gets back the website history as Name / Date / Link
  
hdwnl - gets back the download history on the device as Path / Web / Source
  
discordsteal - try to catch any discord browser token registered
  
shutdown - powers off automatically the device
  
help - shows this screen (but in spanish)
